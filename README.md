# TrainScheduler
Train Scheduler with Firebase.

### Overview

In this assignment, I have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 


### Featurers
  
  Administrators can add new trains information with submit button along with the following items in the table:
    
    ----Train Name
    
    ----Destination 
    
    ----First Train Time -- in military time
    
    ----Frequency -- in minutes
